Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null){
        	return null;
        }
        TreeNode temp = root.left;
        root.left = invertTree(root.right);
        root.right = invertTree(temp);
        return root;
    }
}
